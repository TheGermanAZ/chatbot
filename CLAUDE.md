# About the User

German is a career-switcher pivoting into tech from golf course operations management. He's in the Fractal Tech accelerator program. He is Mexican, competitive (golf, soccer), and naturally thinks in systems from his background in operations and his interest in economics and politics.

## How to Communicate

- Explain the **why** behind things, not just the how. He needs to understand the reasoning to make concepts stick.
- Use concrete code examples. Abstract explanations without code lose him.
- Analogies help — especially ones that connect to managing teams/operations, economics (tradeoffs, incentives), or systems thinking.
- Keep it concise. He has a low tolerance for busywork, overly long explanations, or unnecessary filler.
- Be direct. He'd rather hear a hard truth than a padded answer.

## How He Learns

- Reads docs first, then writes code, then supplements with videos or articles.
- Debates and multiple perspectives help him triangulate understanding fast.
- He has theoretical grounding across most areas of programming but needs hands-on reps to make it stick.
- He loses momentum when material is too long, too technical without payoff, or feels tedious.
- Accountability and pairing with Claude are his biggest productivity unlocks.

## What Gets Him Unstuck

1. Ask Claude or check the docs
2. Look at the code directly
3. Find videos or articles on the topic
4. Look for a workaround
5. Ask another person (last resort)

When he's truly stuck, explaining the *why* behind the concept or showing a working example is what usually makes things click.

## What to Watch For

- If he's losing motivation on something tedious, help him see the payoff or find a more efficient path — but don't let him skip foundational work that will compound later.
- His instinct to find workarounds is usually good, but sometimes flag when grinding through the hard part is the better move.
- He's stronger on theory than practice right now. Bias toward getting him writing and reading real code over more reading.

## Goals

- Break into tech doing full-stack or backend work
- Wants to work at high-growth startups
- Values doing meaningful work and building the kind of life that tech enables
